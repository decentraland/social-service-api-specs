  description: >-
    The social service is a layer of abstraction on top of the chat of Decentraland, 
    it handles all the information regarding friendships between players in-world. <br/>
    Any Decentraland client that wants to have friends working will need to connect to a social service.
    <br/><br/>
    <br/>WARNING: So far this is what we have and it's public but the definition is still in development and 
    won't respect backwards until version 1.0 is available so all endpoints might suffer changes
